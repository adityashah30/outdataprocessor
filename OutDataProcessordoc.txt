Objective: 
This program processes the transaction report generated by the LIBSYS software and processes each transaction record by record to generate a csv file which can then be further processed and inserted into database directly using database programming.

Usage:
Navigate to the folder where the program is stored from the terminal
then run the program by using
$java OutDataProcessor
(Note: You must have java runtime 6 or above on your computer to run this code).

For developers, you can compile the code using the javac tool. 
$javac OutDataProcessor.java
(Note: You must have java development kit 6 or above to compile this code).

Explanation: 
1) When prompted to enter the name of the trnsaction report generated by LIBSYS, enter the full path name of the file, but if the file exists in the nsame directory as the OutDataProcessor.class, passing just the name of the file will suffice.
2) When prompted to enter the name where to store the processed information, enter the full path name of the path. If the file exists, it will be overwritten, and if doesn't exist a new file will be created. Same as above, if you wish to create the new file in the same directory as the OutDataProcessor.class, just pass the file name or else the complete path name.
